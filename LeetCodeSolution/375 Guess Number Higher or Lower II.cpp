/*
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. 
You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
